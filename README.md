This Android App combines multiple of my previous projects into one single app such as - Multiple screens, Changing screens using Explicit Intent, 
Opening the Camera app using implicit intent, opening google using implicit intent, opening phone dialer using implicit intent, multiple images in a layout using 
LinearLayout, Scrolling Text using ScrollView and among other features as well as squashing any and all bugs that popped up when combining features of my previous apps
into one single app .
